          <strong>4 Data Gathering</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4.1 Collection of Information</p>
        <p>
          We may collect information that you share with us through your use of
          our website, for example by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            E-mailing or writing to us using the contact details posted on our
            website; or
          </li>
          <li>Submitting other enquiries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>4.2 Our Use of Your Information</p>
        <p>
          Our primary goal in collecting personally identifiable information is
          to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience.
          This allows us to provide services and features that are most likely
          to meet your needs, and to customize the Website and our services to
          make your experience easier. We may use the information we collect
          from you: to provide you with information and services that you
          request from us. We use personally identifiable information in the
          files we maintain about you, and the other personally identifiable
          information we obtain from your current and past activities on the
          Website to provide you with services.
        </p>
        <p>4.3 Our Disclosure of Your Information</p>
        <p>
          Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all
          of your private communications and other personally identifiable
          information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in
          this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the
          foregoing), we may be required to disclose personally identifiable
          information to the government, law enforcement agencies, or third
          parties under certain circumstances; third parties may unlawfully
          intercept or access transmissions or private communications; or users
          or authorized users may independently abuse or misuse your information
          that they collect from the Website in violation of our Website’s
          Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Therefore, although we use
          industry-standard information security practices to protect your
          privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your
          personally identifiable information or private communications will
          always remain private.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally
          identifiable information about you to any third party. However, the
          following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable
          information may be disclosed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other Corporate Entities: We may sometimes share data with our
          affiliates, associates, subsidiaries, joint ventures, group entities,
          and third-party service providers that provide us with services and/or
          provide you with services. To the extent that these entities have
          access to your personally identifiable information, we will ask them
          to treat it at least as protectively as they treat personally
          identifiable information they obtain from their other authorized users
          or members. Our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures will
          follow privacy practices no less protective of all authorized users
          and members than our practices described in this document, to the
          extent allowed by applicable law. It is possible that Totalis, its
          associates, affiliates, joint ventures or any combination of such,
          could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should
          such a combination occur, you should expect that Totalis would share
          some or all of your personally identifiable information to continue to
          maintain and provide access to the Website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legal Requests: Totalis co-operates with law enforcement inquiries, as
          well as other third parties to enforce laws relating to matters, such
          as intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and
          you authorise us to) disclose any personally identifiable information
          about you to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in
          our sole discretion, believe reasonably necessary or appropriate, in
          connection with any investigation.
        </p>
        <p>4.4 Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information</p>
        <p>
          In case you request to remove your personally identifiable information
          from our records, we will retain such information in our files and
          databases, to use it in some unavoidable circumstances, such as to
          resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our terms and
          conditions. Further, such prior personally identifiable information is
          never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal
          constraints, including stored “backup” systems. Therefore, you should
          not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will
          be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.
        </p>

          Cookies themselves do not personally identify you, but they do
          identify your computer, computer resources and devices connected with
          computer resources and include Mobile phones. Generally, cookies work
          by assigning a unique number to the computer that has no meaning
          outside the assigning site. You are also being made aware that Totalis
          cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by
          advertisers or third parties hosting data on the Totalis website. If

          <strong>5 Security</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Totalis will use reasonable security measures to safeguard the
          confidentiality of your personal identifiable information. Although we
          will put our best efforts to protect your personal data, we cannot

          to try to prevent unauthorised access or inadvertent disclosure.
          However, you agree and acknowledge that “perfect security” does not
          exist on the Internet.
